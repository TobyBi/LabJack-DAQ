# LabJack-DAQ

Object-oriented wrapper of LabJack LJM  to control LabJack [T-Series DAQs](https://labjack.com/products/t7). Classes are provided for timed interval control, asynchronous communication, and output steaming of DACs.



## Requirements

- Python >= 3.8.5
- numpy >= 1.19.5
- [LabJack LJM library](https://labjack.com/support/software/installers/ljm)

- `AsynchUpdater` for using asynchronous read and write to LabJack registers,
- `Intervaler` which allows ensures commands run within a certain interval, and
- `Streamer` which streams data from the LabJack at a set rate.
